          <h2>Project Background</h2>
          <p>
            Within the scope of DesignLab's UX Academy, I worked on this project
            for a big insurance company, Kaus. <br />Kaus is a fictitious
            insurance company, and as the story goes, it provides insurance for
            every situation. In order to keep costs low and provide easy
            solutions for customers, prepared packages are sold instead of fully
            customized options. This allows them to be more efficient and keep
            their rates more economical than their competitors.
          </p>
          <h3>Objectives</h3>
          <p>
            The goal of this project was the creation of a new modern and fresh
            logo for the company, as well as a responsive eCommerce website that
            is pleasing to use and allows customers to browse through all
            products and to easily filter by relevant data.
          </p>
          <h3>Role</h3>
          <p>
            User Research, UX and UI Design
          </p>
          <h3>Timeline</h3>
          <p>4 weeks</p>
          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>
            I approached this project based on the product development process.
            The product development process is a continuous cycle of
            prototyping, testing, and making adjustments and refinements. Based
            on learnings, the design is continuously improved.

        <h2>Discover</h2>
        <h3>Market Trends, Competitor Analysis, User Interviews</h3>
        <p>
          At the beginning of the project, I investigated the topic of insurance
          to learn more about this field and current trends. My findings help me
          to analyze competitors.
        </p>

        <p>
          To gather insights about the user, I conducted user interviews with
          four participants. The participants were between 28 and 58 years old.
          Two of them were male, two female. One of the participants was
          pregnant; one has a child. All four participants purchased insurance
          at least one time online. <br />
          During the interviews, it was possible to observe general goals of
          potential users, also shared needs and pain points were apparent.

        <h2>Define</h2>
        <h3>Personas, Project Goals, Product RoadMap, Sitemap, User Flow</h3>
        <p>
          With the user interviews at hand, I clustered the gathered information
          to find patterns. Based on these patterns, I created two personas -
          Sarah Valentine and Nigel Blackwood.
        </p>
        IMAGE Sarah IMAGE Nigel
        <p>
          Based on the research, I arranged business and user goals into a Venn
          diagram to visualize overlaps. I also took technical considerations
          into account since technical decisions often impact the users and the
          business side.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sitemaps define the hierarchical structure of a website. To help users
          find what they are looking for, I conducted an open Card Sorting
          exercise. While most of the participants clustered all insurances
          together, it was interesting to see that the other had a distinct way
          to organize the insurances. Keeping this in mind helped me to arrange
          the super-category "Insurances".
        </p>
        image site map
        <p>
          I sketched the user flows for the personas Sarah and Nigel. Their goal
          is to find and purchase insurance. The user flow specifies the user's
          path through the website to achieve this goal.

          Responsive UI Design, UI Kit
        </h3>
        <p>
          Sketching is a great way to explore different directions. I attempted
          to lay out several options, iterating on them before creating digital
          files.
        </p>
        image sketches
        <p>
          The previous sketching helped me to create wireframes. These serve as
          a blueprint for the website. I used it to establish the Visual
          Hierarchy and to explore the behavior of elements in low-fidelity.
        </p>
        image wireframes
        <p>
          In the next step, I defined brand attributes. Kaus stands for
          innovative, friendly, honest, dependable, affordable insurance. The
          mood board holds a collection of ideas and inspiration, referring to
          these attributes.
        </p>
        image Moodboard
        <p>
          Logo and wordmark aim to make a brand unique and recognizable. The
          brandâ€™s attributes should be represented. At best, they are making a
          brand iconic.
        </p>
        image logo and wordmark
        <p>
          I explored ways to brand Kaus to make it live up to its attributes. To
          achieve this, I worked on different color schemes that stand out from
          the commonly used blue palettes that only aim to generate trust.
        </p>
        image different color palettes
        <p>
          Kaus is supposed to be insurance for everyone. Therefore I used
          illustrations depicting diverse people from the Open Peeps library
          created by Pablo Stanley.
        </p>
        image peeps in different palettes

          The result is a style tile that showcases the look and feel of the
          design.
        </p>

          Lastly, I combined the wireframes with the envisioned branding and UI
          elements to create a responsive website design.
