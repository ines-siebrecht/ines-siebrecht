            City Night Line, short CNL, was a night train operator of the German
            and Swiss national railways. The emergence from low-cost airlines
            from the early 2000s on led to the termination of its operations in
            2016.<br />

              City Night Line is used as an exercise for how to work within an
              existing, iconic brand in the transactional realm of railways. The
              goal was to design a responsive website that covers the main
              functionality: search for a connection and booking of tickets.
              Redesign the brand with a more modern feel, keeping the essence of
              it still alive.

            Market Trends, Competitor Analysis, User Interviews
          </h3>
          <p>
            Night trains have long served as a means of transportation to travel
            long distances in reasonable amounts of time. But since the advent
            of affordable air travel, the number of night trains has fallen.
            Operators find themselves in the increasingly uncomfortable position
            between high-speed rail services, low-cost airlines, and low-cost
            bus operators.<br />
            I started the project with market research to learn about current
            trends and the future of transportation. Additionally, I analyzed
            possible competitors.
          </p>

          />
          <p>
            To gain insights about people traveling with night trains, I
            conducted a survey. From 40 survey responses, 73% of respondents
            stated to travel at least once a year by train. 46% (14 people) of
            them answered that they traveled already by night train.<br />
            I used an affinity map to group the responses.

            The following conclusions are drawn from the survey.

              <h5>Insights</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  travelers choose night trains mostly to save time
                </li>
                <li>experience and sustainability play a smaller role</li>
                <li>
                  the price is a significant factor for most travelers when
                  booking train tickets, followed by details of the journey like
                  the duration and the number of changes
                </li>
                <li>
                  85% of travelers are using night trains for leisure trips
                </li>
                <li>
                  64% are traveling alone, followed by 28% with family and 21%
                  with a travel group
                </li>
                <li>
                  while 21% state they are booking tickets with via app or
                  respectively buy their ticket at a station, 93% purchase their
                  tickets per website mostly using a desktop computer (71%)
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5>Needs</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  passengers need an easy way to find tickets for the best price
                </li>
                <li>
                  for frequent travelers, it is essential to have a degree of
                  service offerings, f.e. the possibility to cancel or
                  reschedule their tickets
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5>Pain Points</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  intransparent pricing, f.e. when it is not clear upfront that
                  service fees are applied or when there are different prices
                  for the same comfort category
                </li>
                <li>
                  it is annoying when it is necessary to buy tickets from
                  different train operators, or knowledge of the railroad
                  network is needed to find the best connections
                </li>

            Personas, Sitemap, User Flow
          </h3>
          <p>
            In the next step, I clustered the gathered information to find
            patterns. At first, the similarities between all travelers seemed to
            lead to only one persona. But on a closer look, the differences
            between frequent travelers and the occasional traveler were too
            distinct.
          </p>
          <img
            class="caseStudy__image"
            src="city-night-line/cluster-persona-one.jpg"
            alt="cluster for first persona"
          />
          <img
            class="caseStudy__image"
            src="city-night-line/cluster-persona-two.jpg"
            alt="cluster for second persona"
          />
          <p>
            Eventually, I split them up to create two personas. Please meet Emma
            Anderson and Paul Novak.
          </p>
          <img
            class="caseStudy__image"
            src="city-night-line/persona-emma-andersson.png"
            alt="primary persona Emma Anderson"
          />
          <img
            class="caseStudy__image"
            src="city-night-line/persona-paul-novak.png"
            alt="secondary persona Paul Novak"
          />
          <p>
            For the definition of the sitemap, I conducted an open Card Sorting.
            The results of this exercise were quite ambiguous. The users’
            agreement where to place menu items was not conclusive enough to
            create a sitemap. Therefore I conducted a second round of Card
            Sorting. Based on the first results, I provided categories to the
            participants, but allowed the creation of own categories if
            necessary. The results turned out more distinct to create a sitemap.
          </p>

            alt="sitemap of the CNL website"
          />
          <p>
            The most important task for the personas is to purchase tickets.
            Thus I modeled the user flow accordingly.
          </p>

            Responsive UI Design
          </h3>
          <p>
            Before I started creating wireframes in the digital realm, I
            scribbled several ideas for the screens in a Crazy Eights activity.
            This exercise helped me to ideate and eventually create the
            wireframes.
          </p>
          <img
            class="caseStudy__image"
            src="city-night-line/wireframes.png"
            alt="wireframes in different viewports"
          />
          <p>
            With the wireframes at hand, I created a low-fidelity prototype to
            evaluate the user flow. <br />
            I conducted a remote usability test with two tasks. The two
            scenarios model the main goals of the personas:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              booking a ticket to a specific destination with flexible dates
            </li>
            <li>
              researching a possible destination with a set date range and
              budget
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While the first assignment worked as intended, the performance of
            the second one was rather unsatisfying. The task had a bounce rate
            of 50%, while the other 50% of users could only indirectly finish
            the mission. Interestingly all users who indirectly finished the
            first scenario began browsing on the "Explore our destinations"
            page. They rated their satisfaction with the booking process as high
            (on average 8 on a scale from 0 to 9). <br />
            I used a Feedback Grid to gather and organize the user feedback.
          </p>
          <img
            class="caseStudy__image"
            src="city-night-line/feedback-grid-first-user-test.jpg"
            alt="feedback grid of the first user test"
          />
          <p>
            The feedback helped me to iterate over the wireframes. Validating
            assumptions helps to make informed decisions. Testing in an early
            stage of a project has the benefit that changes are easier to make
            and it can prevent going in the wrong direction.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the user flow in place, I focused on the branding. <br />
            First, I gathered ideas and inspirations on a mood board. For the
            color palette, I took inspiration by neon lights that pass by the
            windows when traveling by night. Yet, the colors are intended to
            have a modern, luxurious feel.
          </p>

            Logo and wordmark are an essential part of a brand. Since City Night

            keep its essence.
