      <article>
        In the last seven years, I worked in various fields (if you ask IoT,
        Automotive aftermarket, Fashion, etc.) as a developer. But something was
        always missing - solving problems on a greater scale. While developers
        constantly solve problems, work closely together with Product Owners,
        Designers, and other stakeholders, their creativity is often limited to
        technical aspects of product development. In UI/UX design, I found a way
        to look at problems more broadly, from different angles, if you will, to
        find the best solutions. I believe that every challenge can be overcome
        with great ideas and the right people to execute them. Apart from work,
        I identify as an outdoorsy couch potato. I love to go on hiking and
        trekking adventures (where have you been? I'd love to hear about it and
        your gear), and in winter, I can't wait to snowboard. Still, a genuinely
        relaxing evening on my couch is hard to beat.
